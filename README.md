# Referral Builder

This app is built with a minimal **React + TypeScript** configuration, using **Babel** as the TypeScript to JavaScript transpiler. It leverages **Webpack** for asset bundling, optimization, and code splitting. The app is designed to take advantage of **@reduxjs/toolkit** for action and reducer generation and utilizes **redux-saga** for handling async API calls.

### **1. Clone or Fork the Repository**

Copy the contents of `.env.example` into `.env` and configure it as needed.

### **5. Set the API URL**

Assign the following value to the `API_URL` variable in the `.env` file:

```sh
API_URL=https://referral-builder-api-1d1d57f1a7a7.herokuapp.com/
```

**(Make sure to include the `/` at the end.)**

### **6. Start the Development Server**
